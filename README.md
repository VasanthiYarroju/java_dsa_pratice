# 🧠 Java DSA Practice

Welcome to my personal **Java-based DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice** repository!  
This repo contains structured solutions to coding problems I'm practicing regularly to master problem-solving, logic, and core DSA patterns.

## 📅 Weekly Progress Log

### 🔹 **Week 1: Foundation Week**
> 🗓️ Topics Practiced:
- ✅ Arrays (1D & 2D)
- ✅ Strings (Basic to Intermediate)
- ✅ HashSet (for unique element handling, duplicates, etc.)
- ✅ Sliding Window Technique (Fixed and Variable size)

---

### 🔹 **Week 2: Core Data Structures & Searching**
> 🗓️ Topics Practiced:
- ✅ HashMap (Key-Value based problem solving, frequency count, grouping)
- ✅ Stacks (Balanced parentheses, Next Greater Element, etc.)
- ✅ Queues (Sliding window max, BFS-style problems)
- ✅ Binary Search (Search in sorted arrays, lower/upper bounds, rotated arrays)

### 🔹 **Week 3: Linked Lists, Trees & Sorting**
> 🗓️ Topics Practiced:

- ✅ Linked Lists (Singly, Merge Lists, Middle Node, Cycle detection)

- ✅ Binary Trees (DFS, BFS, Inorder/Preorder/Postorder traversals)

- ✅ Binary Search Trees (Insert, Search, Lowest Common Ancestor)

- ✅ Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort)
